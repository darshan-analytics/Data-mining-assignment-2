DARSHAN RAMCHANDRA DESAI [B00816526]: CS 535 Introduction to Data Mining (Section 2)

##Important Things
There are two text files and two python files included.
assignment2.py contains the question number one to five .
autoencoder.py contains question number six to run this file tensorflow environment is needed to install. 
Cluster starts from 0 - 4. 
Clusters are not renamed with the index.
Solution is in assignment2(sol).pdf file.


## Installation

python -m pip install sklearn
python -m pip install --upgrade tensorflow
python -m pip install keras
```
for python3 use the following commands
```python
python3 -m pip install numpy
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
python3 -m pip install pandas
python3 -m pip install statsmodels
python3 -m pip install sklearn
python3 -m pip install scipy
python3 -m pip install --upgrade tensorflow
python3 -m pip install keras
```

## Usage
Compile the code by using the following command

```python
python3 assignment2.py
python3 autoencoder.py
```
